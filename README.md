## About

A simple script to create a Google Chrome SSB (site specific browser) in OS X.

Based on [osx-chrome-ssb-gui](https://github.com/dmarmor/osx-chrome-ssb-gui).

This is a very first approach, I expect to make a few "tweaks" onwards.

## Notes

Each created SSB has his own profile in `${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Google Chrome SSB`.
